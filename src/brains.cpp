    Standby: Power is on, systems are idle, and the rocket sits on the pad waiting for final arming.
    Boost (Launch): The motor ignites and the rocket accelerates upward off the pad, detected by high G-force and positive velocity.
    Coast: Motor burnout occurs, and the rocket continues climbing upward on momentum until it reaches apogee.
    Apogee: The highest point of the flight where vertical velocity hits zero, which triggers the primary deployment event (drogue parachute or main depending on dual-deploy).
    Descent / Descent: The parachutes deploy, and the rocket floats safely back down to the ground.
    Landed: The rocket lands, detected by zero movement and zero vertical velocity, signaling the end of the flight profile.
